# EthGlobal Hackathon Project

## Overview

Our project enables services that require **KYC (Know Your Customer)** to verify whether a wallet address has already undergone KYC by a **trusted provider**.

This is achieved by passing KYC verification through a trusted provider which, once successful, issues an **on-chain proof**. The provider signs a transaction and sends it to a logging contract on the **Flare network**, associating the verification with the user’s wallet address.

Other services that require KYC can then check this on-chain proof to confirm the wallet address has already been verified, removing the need for repeated KYC checks.

### Try It Yourself!
- Login to our mock KYC provider: https://ethglobal-kyc-provider.vercel.app/
  - Verify your wallet address
- Paste the wallet address you verified on our mock KYC verifier: https://ethglobal-kyc-verifier.vercel.app/

## How It Works

1. **KYC Verification**
   - The user undergoes KYC through a trusted provider.
   - Once verified, the provider signs a transaction proving KYC completion.
   - This signed proof is sent to a logging contract and tied to the user’s wallet address.

2. **Privacy & Security with Turnkey**
   - User KYC data is never sent directly in plaintext.
   - Instead, a Turnkey embedded wallet is created to **encrypt data** into an **encryption bundle**.
   - The encryption bundle is created at the time of sending, ensuring only the provider can decrypt it in their backend. For more detail [see here](#turnkey-encryption-flow)
   - This guarantees complete end-to-end security of sensitive data.

3. **On-Chain Proof Only**
   - The **raw KYC data never touches the blockchain**.
   - Only a **signed payload** (generated by the user’s embedded wallet) is pushed on-chain.
   - This ensures no sensitive information is exposed, while still allowing verifiable proof of KYC.

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **User Privacy First**: Sensitive data is always encrypted and never exposed on-chain.
- ✅ **Reusable KYC Proofs**: Users don’t need to redo KYC for each service; proofs are verifiable on-chain.
- ✅ **Trust Through Providers**: Services can rely on on-chain proofs that we're signed by KYC providers they recognize as trustworthy.
- ✅ **Secure Infrastructure**: Leverages Turnkey’s embedded wallets for encryption and Flare for decentralized proof verification.

## Turnkey Encryption Flow

1. **Encryption Wallet Creation**
   - When a user requests KYC verification, a dedicated wallet is created within the user’s sub-organization.
   - A delegated access user is granted permissions on this wallet **only**, enforced through Turnkey’s policy engine.

2. **Data Encryption**
   - The user’s KYC data is encrypted using the encryption wallet’s public key.
   - This encrypted payload can then be safely transmitted to the KYC provider’s backend.

3. **Data Decryption**
   - Once received, the provider’s delegated access user can export the encryption wallet.
   - Using the wallet’s private key, the provider decrypts the data and proceeds with the verification process.

> At no point is the user’s sensitive data ever exposed in plaintext within unsafe environments.
